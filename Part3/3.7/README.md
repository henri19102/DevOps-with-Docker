# exercise 3.7 answers:

In this exercise, I used project spring-example-project, which was involved in course material. First I tried to make image with alpine image. I was able to reduce image size from 619 MB to 146 MB. Later I tried image "openjdk:8-jre-alpine" which reduced image size from 146 MB to 103 MB
